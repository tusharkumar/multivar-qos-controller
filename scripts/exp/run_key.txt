mpeg2enc MVSRT experiments
9 => neither
10 => modified budget-allocate (so C refines even when not exceeded bounds)
11 => force-model-estimation (probabilistic reduction in LLSE)
12 => both
13 => both of previous, frame_budget = 5% (instead of 1%)
14 => (run 10) + (2% frame-budget)
17 => affine, no subtract
17.6 => uncommented reset-betas when new C constructed (but shouldn't matter, due to forced beta resets)
18   => disabled adaptive betas, affine=true
18.1 => enabled  adaptive betas, affine=true
19.1 => moved adaptive_state_transition() to before update_modeli() and update_controller(),
         commented out proj_st from update_controller (as adaptive_state_transition() would already executed),
         added state re-initialization to update_controllerZO()
19.2 => 19.1 + disabled adaptive betas
20.1 => new update_controller() using refine_input_costs() scheme (Dec 14, 2012 - Jan 6, 2013)
20.2-20.4 => repeat for comparison

23.1 => replaced incremental-LQR with fresh N=1 LQR solve for each C refinement step
23.2 => enabled adaptive betas
24.* => added adaptive length of random input exploration. Variants force d=1 (adaptive length) and adaptive betas
25.* => added frequent M <- Mp whenever Mp exhibits lower error. Variants for d=1 and adaptive betas.
26.* => new update_model() that systematically estimated Mp and updates M based on convergent sum metrics
        -- mmf variants 26.3, 26.4 ==> update_model() tests all_x_min_max_differ to update M from Mp on Advantage,
                     and forcedExploration == false is now needed to allow new Mp to be estimated
27.1fixes => fix all_x_min_max_differ to all_x_min_max_span, and square the norm
27.2nfe   => new forced exploration algorithm, no adaptive betas
27.3nfeab => with adaptive betas
27.4      => 27.3 + budget=2% instead of 1%
28.1      => forced exploration now uses separate "current" (10*W frames) and "estimated" (for all of M) metrics for SR and alpha.
29.1      => shifted to mean, std history coverage from min-max-based history coverage criterion
30.1      => fixed mean, std incremental stats to be more robust
30.2      => changed coverage threshold from 0.5 to 0.3
31        =>
32        => added maxswing criterion to coverage-test, minor additional case in input_explorer
33        => added L_min (forcing L_min = 32 for mpeg2enc variants); coverage f = 0.5, g = (1+gamma)/2
33.2      => L_min = 64 for mpeg2enc variants
34.0hist0 => achievability stats updated every 10 * W model-driven frames, min history = 0 (i.e., history like before)
34.1hist70 => same + min history = 70 (10 * W)
34.2hist35 => same + min history = 35 (5 * W)
35.1      => new stability length and coverage length estimations to drive resize_history() (disabled min history)
36.1      => new resize_history() based on Ls, t_bcp and Lc metrics
37.1      => PFE cluster length estimation from H statistics.
38.1      => cleaned up frame-budget.
38.2      => repeat (except for mpeg2enc: accidentally clobbered by 38.3)
38.3      => incorporated num_clusters to divide L_PFE (to ensure q doesn't become too small when theta is non-trivial)
39.1      => fixed stabilitymetrics to use OB_importance; theta_SR limited <= 0.10 (instead of 0.50); theta_alpha disabled; PFE d_high = 3 * d_peak (instead of 2 * d_peak); betas disabled
39.2      => enabled betas; fixed betas to persist across C refinement, reset only on new M
39.3      => improved beta updates to more precisely track model-quality: prevent updates for W frames after exploration, reset metrics (but not betas) across exploration
40.1      => PFE cluster of length L completes only after ensuring coverage;
             and, unbiased input exploration of all input dimensions regardless of current coverage
41.1      => various fixes for assert failures, restricted model-estimation for balance to half of frame-budget (to not consume all the budget when balance is not achievable),
             beta update skipped on frames overridding control-inputs
42.1      => Replaced alpha/tau for MSEQ theta with scoped SR to control theta.
             Changed sluggishness correction factor be sqrt 1/beta when beta < 1 (to compensate faster for excessive Osc correction)
42.2, 42.3 repeats
43.1      => PFE cluster group
43.2      => repeat
